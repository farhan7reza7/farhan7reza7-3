[Speaker 1] Hello everyone, and welcome to our session today.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
[Speaker 2] Thank you for having us. We're excited to be here.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
[Speaker 1] Let's dive right in. Our first topic is the new project roadmap.

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.000
[Speaker 3] I’ll provide an overview of the project milestones and deliverables.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.000
[Speaker 2] And I’ll discuss the team’s role in achieving these goals.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.000
[Speaker 1] Sounds good. Let’s start with the roadmap.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.000
[Speaker 3] The first milestone is the initial project kickoff.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.000
[Speaker 2] Followed by the completion of the design phase.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
[Speaker 1] We anticipate completing the design phase by the end of this quarter.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000
[Speaker 3] After that, we’ll move on to the development phase.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
[Speaker 2] We’re looking forward to the development phase and the challenges it will bring.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.000
[Speaker 1] Great, any questions about the roadmap so far?

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.000
[Speaker 2] None from my side.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.000
[Speaker 3] Everything looks clear on my end too.
